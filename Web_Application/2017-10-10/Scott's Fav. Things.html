		Friedrich Nietzsche (German philologist, philosopher, cultural critic, poet and composer) once said <q>Without music, life would be a mistake</q>.
		I think, I cannot live without music. My favorite genre is funk and punk rock.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Did you know that I used to play Bass guitar in a band during in my 20s? Our band mostly played punk rocks (original + several covers) in small gigs.
		Now, it's a bit difficult to spare time and play Bass and, unfortunately, I also had to sell my Bass when I was leaving Paris. 
		But, in 2014, I would like to get a new Bass and play it on my spare time.
